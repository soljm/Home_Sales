# Home Sales

From Module 22: Big Data from the Data Analytics Boot Camp by Monash University and EdX.

By implementing skills learnt throughout the module, an attempt at the challenge has been submitted here.

## Content

- `Home_Sales.ipynb` file with main code using Google Colaboratory

## Explanation

**This assignment was completed on Google Colaboratory.**

After importing the dataset, a `Spark DataFrame` was created. A temporary view was created to query the data to answer the questions for the assignment.

The temporary table was cached and the runtime for the uncached and cached queries were compared. The cached query took less time to run compared to the uncached query.

The data was then partitioned and another temporary table was created for the parquet data. The data was queried again and the runtime was compared to the uncached runtime. The partitioned data was faster than the uncached data.

The table was then uncached.

## Credits

Data for this dataset was generated by EdX Boot Camps LLC.

Code was taken from in-class activities and modified accordingly.
